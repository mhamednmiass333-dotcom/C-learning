# Table of Squares in C

This project demonstrates how to print a table of numbers and their squares using a simple loop in C.

## 📄 Description

- The program prompts the user to enter how many entries they want in the table.
- It then prints each number from 1 up to the entered number, along with its square, using a `while` loop.

## 📝 Usage

1. **Compile the program:**
   ```sh
   gcc -o table_of_squares table_of_squares.c
   ```

2. **Run the executable:**
   ```sh
   ./table_of_squares
   ```

3. **Example interaction:**
   ```
   This program prints a table of squares.
   Enter number of enteries in table : 5
   1		1
   2		4
   3		9
   4		16
   5		25
   ```

## 💡 How It Works

- The program uses a `while` loop to iterate from 1 to the user-provided number.
- On each iteration, it prints the current number and its square in a tabular format.
