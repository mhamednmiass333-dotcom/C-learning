### Exercise 2.02
Consider the following program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Parkinson's Law:\nWork expands so as to ");
    printf("fill the time\n");
    printf("available for its completion.\n");
    return 0;
}
```
(a) Identify the directives and statements in this program.  
(b) What output does the program produce?

### Solution
#### (a)
Directives : 

            #include<stdio.h> line 1

Statements : 


             printf("Parkinson's Law:\nWork expands so as to "); line 5
    
             printf("fill the time\n"); line 6

             printf("available for its completion.\n"); line 7

             return 0; line 8

#### (b)
The program output :

```
Parkinson's Law:
Work expands so as to fill the time
available for its completion.
```
