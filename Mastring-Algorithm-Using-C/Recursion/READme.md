# Recursion Projects in C

Welcome to the **Recursion Projects** section of the mastering C algorithm and data structure folder!

This directory is dedicated to C projects and exercises that focus on the concept of recursion. Here, you'll find practical implementations and problem-solving approaches that use recursive techniques, reinforcing both your understanding of recursion and your C programming skills.

## üìö About

Recursion is a powerful programming paradigm where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. Mastering recursion is essential for tackling many classic problems in computer science, such as:

- Divide and conquer algorithms
- Mathematical computations (factorials, Fibonacci sequence, etc.)
- Data structure traversal (trees, graphs)
- Backtracking problems (maze solving, N-Queens, etc.)

## üìÇ Structure

- Each file or subfolder implements a specific recursion-based project or problem.
- Code is well-commented to explain the recursive logic and base/recursive cases.
- Sample input/output and explanations are provided where useful.

## üöÄ Example Topics

- Factorial calculation
- Fibonacci series (recursive and optimized)
- Sum of array elements using recursion
- Tower of Hanoi
- Recursive binary search
- String reversal using recursion
- Tree traversal (preorder, inorder, postorder)
- Backtracking problems
- More to come!

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. Navigate to this folder in your terminal:
   ```sh
   cd mastering\ C\ algorithm\ and\ data\ structure/recursion
   ```
2. Compile the desired C file with a C compiler:
   ```sh
   gcc -o output_executable source_file.c
   ./output_executable
   ```
3. Review code comments for insights into the recursive process.
