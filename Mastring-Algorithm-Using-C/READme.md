# mastering C algorithm and data structure

Welcome to the **mastering C algorithm and data structure** folder!  
This section is dedicated to my journey in learning, implementing, and mastering fundamental algorithms and data structures using the C programming language.

## 📚 About

Here you'll find a collection of C projects and exercises focused on:

- Classic algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, etc.)
- Fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, etc.)
- Problem-solving and optimization techniques
- Explanatory comments and code samples to reinforce concepts

My aim is to build a strong foundation in C while tackling common algorithmic challenges and understanding data structure implementation from scratch.

## 📂 Structure

- Each subfolder or file tackles a specific algorithm or data structure.
- Source files are well-commented for clarity and learning.
- Where applicable, sample inputs/outputs and test cases are provided.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- Searching algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)
- Recursion and iterative solutions
- Linked Lists (singly, doubly, circular)
- Stacks and Queues (array and linked list implementations)
- Trees (binary trees, BSTs, traversals)
- Graphs (adjacency matrix/list, BFS, DFS)
- Hash Tables & Hashing techniques
- Other classic algorithmic challenges

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   ```
2. Navigate to this folder:
   ```sh
   cd mastering\ C\ algorithm\ and\ data\ structure
   ```
3. Compile the C files using a C compiler like `gcc`:
   ```sh
   gcc -o output_executable source_file.c
   ./output_executable
   ```

## 📖 Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of C syntax
- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Willingness to experiment and learn!
